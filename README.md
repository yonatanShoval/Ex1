# Chess_Queens
Have you ever wondered if you could place eight queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard, so that no two queens would threaten each other?

This program comes to answer this question.
But not just that, in addition, it can show you attractively how many solutions there are, for each queen you place on the board.
Every time you drag a queen, the program calculate recursively how many solutions left.
